      "In this project, I focused on several key features: user management to ensure proper model access control and authentication, and a model chaining feature allowing users to create reusable workflows with PDF-to-text, image-to-text, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, text-summarization, and translation. I also integrated the Autogen feature as a Micro-Frontend, enhancing functionality. The translation component involved mapping Supported Languages API, Auto Detect Language API, and Translate API for seamless translation capabilities. I developed a Chat UI component for image analysis that stores responses from user interactions, ensuring smooth and consistent presentation. Additionally, I created a content generation feature where users can input prompts and get content generated accordingly.",
